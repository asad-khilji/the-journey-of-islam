      <h3>There are three kinds of Arabic</h3>
      <ol>
          <li>Spoken Arabic</li>
            <ul>
                <li>It is dialetical</li>
                <li>Each Arab state has its own kind of Arabic</li>
                <li>When speaking with someone</li>
                <li>When ordering food</li>
                <li>When watching tv or movies</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Formal Arabic</li>
            <ul>
                <li>It is used in formal writing</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Old Arabic</li>
            <ul>
                <li>It is the language of the Quran</li>
                <li>It died in the desert years ago</li>
                <li>It has been preserved along with the Quran and the Hadith</li>
            </ul>
      </ol>

      <h3>The Arabic Language</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>The Arabs had Greek, Roman, and Persian neigbors</li>
          <li>But everyone had left the Arabs alone</li>
          <li>The Arabs had nothing and oil was not discovered yet</li>
          <li>When you are left alone then you talk to each other</li>
          <li>When there is outside language then the original language dies</li>
          <li>When there is not outside influence the original language is preserved</li>
          <li>Then your language becomes more and more refined</li>
          <li>Every nation has something to be proud of</li>
          <li>The Arabs figured they had the world's best language</li>
          <li>So they preserved the language and made it better and better</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The Example of an Arab Poet</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>There was an Arab poet who was poor and married</li>
          <li>One day his wife complained to him about the sustenance</li>
          <li>So he replied to her with poetry</li>
          <li>He said heavy rain is at war with a house on a hill</li>
          <li>Heavy Rain also means sustenace from Allah</li>
          <li>So he is saying lots of wealth comes to me, but I am such a high person</li>
          <li>When wealth comes it leaves me and goes down to the people below in the flood and the mud</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>There are three Preservation Movements</h3>
      <ol>
          <li>To Protect the Quran</li>
            <ul>
                <li>It has been preserved through memorization</li>
                <li>It was preserved in the hearts of the Sahaba</li>
                <li>Allah has kept it protected</li>
            </ul>
          <li>To Protect the Hadith</li>
            <ul>
                <li>It has been preserved through memorization</li>
                <li>It was preserved in the hearts of the Sahaba</li>
                <li>Allah has kept it protected</li>
            </ul>
          <li>To Protect the Arabic Language</li>
            <ul>
                <li>It has been preserved through memorization</li>
                <li>Sahaba went into the outskirts of the city to preserve the original language</li>
                <li>Outside influence changes the language</li>
                <li>But Allah has kept it protected</li>
            </ul>
      </ol>

      <h3>Example</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>When you look at a diamond with dirty glasses it looks nice</li>
          <li>When you look at the same diamond with clean glasses it looks amazing</li>
          <li>Spoken and Formal Arabic is looking at the Quran with dirty glasses</li>
          <li>Old Arabic is looking at the Quran with clean glasses</li>
      </ul>
