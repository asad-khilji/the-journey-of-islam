      <h2>الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ</h2>
      <h3>Hadith Qudsi</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>There is a Hadith Qudsi in which Allah says He has divided the prayer (Fatihah) between Allah and us</li>
          <li>When we say Praise and Thanks is for Allah Master of all people, Allah says My slave has praised me</li>
          <li>When we say The extremely loving and caring, Allah says My Slave has praised Me more</li>
          <li>When we say Owner of the day of judgment, Allah says My Slave has glorified Me</li>
          <li>When we says You alone we worship and You alone we seek help from, Allah says This is between Me and My Slave and My slave shall have whatever he or she is asking for</li>
          <li>When we say Guide us to the straight path, Allah says it is guranteed</li>
          <li>When we say the path of those whom You have favored, Allah says it is guaranteed</li>
          <li>When we say But not the path of those who received wrath upon themselves, Allah says it is guranteed</li>
          <li>When we say And not of the lost, Allah says it is guranteed</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Hamd</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Hamd means Praise and Thanks</li>
        <li>You can praise without thanking and you can thank without praising</li>
        <li>Musa thanks the pharoah for raising him but he does not praise him as a god</li>
        <li>Ibrahim thanks his father for raising him but he does not praise his worship of the idols</li>
        <li>We must have two attitudes in mind, praise and thanks</li>
        <li>We cannot complain after saying this statement</li>
        <li>We must find a genuine reason to praise and thank Allah</li>
        <li>Our deen begins with optimism and a positive attitude</li>
        <li>This is a complete change in thought and attitude</li>
        <li>Hamd means genuine and sincere praise and thanks</li>
        <li>Shukr means thanks but it is not genuine and sincere thanks</li>
        <li>Gratitude and Thanks is a reaction</li>
