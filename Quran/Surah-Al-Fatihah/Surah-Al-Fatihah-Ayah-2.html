        <a href="../Surah-Al-Fatihah/Surah-Al-Fatihah.html"><h1>Surah Al Fatihah Ayah 2</h1></a>

       <h2>الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ</h2>

       <h3>Rahm and Rahma</h3>
       <ul>
           <li>Rahm means the womb of the mother</li>
           <li>It comes from the same root word as the word Rahma</li>
           <li>In the womb of the mother everything is taken care of</li>
           <li>The child is completely wrapped up in the care of the mother</li>
           <li>The child has no idea how much love and care its mother is showing it</li>
           <li>All burden and difficulties is taken care of by the mother</li>
           <li>The child is in the state of Rahma</li>
           <li>Allah is 70 times more loving and caring than our mothers</li>
           <li>Allah is constantly taking care of us even when we don't remember Him</li>
           <li>Rahma is Allah's love and care for us</li>
           <li>When the child cries it goes back to its mother</li>
           <li>When we sin we turn back to Allah</li>
       </ul>

       <h3>The Three Qualities of Ar Rahman</h3>
       <ol>
           <li>The love and care of Allah is extreme</li>
           <li>The love and care of Allah is happening right now</li>
           <li>The love and care of Allah is temporary and it could be taken away</li>
           <ul>
               <li>Like extreme thirst can be taken away with water</li>
               <li>Like extreme hunger can be taken away with food</li>
               <li>Like when we sin and get Allah's love and care taken away from us</li>
           </ul>
       </ol>

       <h3>The Two Qualities of Ar Raheem</h3>
       <ol>
           <li>The love and care of Allah is permanent</li>
           <li>The love and care of Allah is not happening right now</li>
       </ol>

       <h3>Example</h3>
       <ul>
           <li>You are really hungry</li>
           <li>Your wife is making dinner</li>
           <li>While she is making dinner she says what do you want to eat tomorrow</li>
           <li>You say I don't care about tomorrow I need my food right now</li>
           <li>Then after dinner is served and you eat, you say what about tomorrow</li>
           <li>We can have this or that</li>
       </ul>

       <h3>Reality</h3>
       <ul>
           <li>Allah mentions Ar Rahman first then Ar Raheem</li>
           <li>Allah takes care of our immediate needs first then our future</li>
           <li>Allah knows who He created</li>
           <li>We are impatient human beings and we need everything right now</li>
       </ul>

       <h3>Ibn Abbas says</h3>
       <ul>
           <li>Ar Rahman is for everyone in this world</li>
           <li>Ar Raheem is for the believers in the next world</li>
           <li>This world is temporary like the qualities of Ar Rahman are temporary</li>
           <li>The next world is permanent like the qualities of Ar Raheem are permanent</li>
       </ul>

       <h3>An Ocean with Waves</h3>
       <ul>
           <li>You cannot imagine an ocean with big waves and a calm ocean at the same time</li>
           <li>The qualities of Ar Rahman is like an ocean with big waves</li>
           <li>The qualities of Ar Raheem is like a calm ocean</li>
           <li>Allah is both qualities of Ar Rahman and Ar Raheem at the same time</li>
           <li>The Rahma of Allah is beyond human comprehension</li>
       </ul>

       <h3>Alhamdulillah</h3>
       <ul>
           <li>We started with Praise and Thanks is for Allah</li>
           <li>Then we said Master of all nations and people</li>
           <li>The quality of this Master is always extremely loving and caring</li>
           <li>Now tell me any other master that is loving and caring like Allah</li>
           <li>You will not find anyone ever</li>
           <li>We are even incapable of being loving and caring to our ownselves because we could harm ourselves</li>
           <li>Anything Allah tells us to do is for our benefit and not Allah</li>
           <li>Allah needs nothing and does not benefit from us servng Him</li>
           <li>The best of deeds is only for ourselves</li>
           <li>Human beings put burdens on themselves and Allah removes them</li>
       </ul>
