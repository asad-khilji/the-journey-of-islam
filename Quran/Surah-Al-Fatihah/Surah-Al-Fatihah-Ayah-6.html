       <h2>صِرَاطَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ</h2>

       <h3>The Path of those whom You have favored</h3>
       <ul>
            <li>The path of those who are relaxed in their walk</li>
            <li>Allah made the path easy for them</li>
            <li>They are almost effortless in their movement like cattle walking</li>
            <li>It is like going up an escalator</li>
            <li>Those who had beneficial knowledge and acted upon it</li>
            <li>The result of going up this path is from Allah</li>
            <li>This ayah is in the past tense so these people are only found in the past</li>
            <li>The Quran is full of stories of people who already made this journey and Allah told us they passed</li>
            <li>Every story in the Quran will help you on this path and it is revelant until the day of judgment</li>
            <li>Their stories are my companions on this Journey</li>
       </ul>

       <h3>Who are the People of this path?</h3>
       <ol>
            <li>The Prophets</li>
            <li>Those who confirmed truth in the Prophets</li>
            <li>The Martyrs</li>
            <li>The Righteous</li>
