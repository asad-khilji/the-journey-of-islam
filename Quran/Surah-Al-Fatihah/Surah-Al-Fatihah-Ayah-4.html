       <h2>إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ</h2>

       <h3>Iyyaka Na Budu</h3>
       <ul>
            <li>It is only to You we willingly gives ourselves in slavery and worship</li>
            <li>We are now engaged in a direct conversation with Allah</li>
            <li>Allah the most important Being is talking to you and me, What an Honor!</li>
            <li>We make decisions based on our intellect</li>
            <li>We make decisions because our heart is compelled towards it</li>
            <li>We thought about who Allah is and our emotions were shaken</li>
            <li>We willingly enslaves ourselves to Allah with both heart and mind</li>
            <li>Surah Al Fatihah is re-starting your relationship with Allah</li>
            <li>We must ask why we are Muslim over and over again</li>
            <li>We now made a commitment to Allah to be His slave 24/7</li>
            <li>Salah is a practical demonstration of slavery to Allah</li>
            <li>We become better slaves after each salah</li>
       </ul>

       <h3>Iyyaka Nastain</h3>
       <ul>
            <li>We made a commitment to Allah that we will be His slave 24/7</li>
            <li>It is a hard commitment and we need help</li>
            <li>So the next thing we ask is help from Allah</li>
            <li>We do not ask what we need help in</li>
            <li>It is because the list is so long that we need help in everything</li>
            <li>It is also because we are desperate</li>
            <li>When you are desperate then you are short on words</li>
       </ul>

       <h3>Example</h3>
       <ul>
            <li>Imagine you are hanging onto a tree about to fall from a cliff</li>
            <li>You do not say could you please help me, I am about to fall from this cliff and could possibly get injury leading to death</li>
            <li>Instead you just yell HELP!</li>
       </ul>

       <h3>The way to ask for help</h3>
       <ul>
            <li>You put in the effort then Allah sends His help</li>
            <li>If you do not put in the effort, Allah's help will not come</li>
            <li>There are two extremes</li>
            <li>Some people say I did everything while other people do nothing</li>
            <li>Both these extremes are wrong</li>
            <li>We must put in the effort then ask Allah for help</li>
            <ul><h3>First Scenario</h3>
                <li>You have a flat tire</li>
                <li>Then you ask for help</li>
                <li>Someone comes and helps you while you are sitting doing nothing</li>
            </ul>
            <ul><h3>Second Scenario</h3>
                <li>You have a flat tire</li>
                <li>Then you ask for help</li>
                <li>Someone comes and helps you while you are trying to fix it yourself</li>
            </ul>
            <li>The second scenario is the right way to ask Allah for help</li>
            <li>Success = your efforts + results from Allah</li>
            <li>Allah is asking for your best efforts</li>
            <li>Results and help is only in the hands of Allah</li>
            <li>Allah will not give His help to those who do not show effort</li>
       </ul>
