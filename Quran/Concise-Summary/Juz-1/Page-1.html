      <h3>Surah Al Fatihah</h3>
      <p>1. The Ultimate Praise and Thanks is for Allah, Master of all Nations and People</p>
      <p>2. The extremely loving and caring right now, the always extremely loving and caring</p>
      <p>3. The owner and the king of the say of judgment</p>
      <p>4. You alone we worship and You alone we as for help</p>
      <p>5. Guide us on the straight path upwards</p>
      <p>6. The path of those whom You have favored</p>
      <p>7. But not the path of those who had anger upon them nor of the lost</p>

      <h3>Surah Al Baqarah</h3>
      <p>1. Alif Laam Meem</p>
      <p>2. That is the Book. There is absolutely no doubt in it. Guidance! for the cautious</p>
      <p>3. Who believe in the unseen, establish salah, and, only in what We provided them, they spend</p>
      <p>4. And who believe in whatever was sent to you and whatever was sent much before you and in the afterlife they have absolute conviction</p>
      <p>5. Those people are commited to guidance from their Master and those people are the reapers of success</p>
