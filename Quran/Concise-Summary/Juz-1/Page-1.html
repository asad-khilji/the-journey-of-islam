      <h3>Surah Al Fatihah</h3>
      <p>1. The Ultimate Praise and Thanks is for Allah, Master of all Nations and People</p>
      <p>2. The extremely loving and caring right now, the always extremely loving and caring</p>
      <p>3. The owner and the king of the day of judgment</p>
      <p>4. You alone we worship and You alone we as for help</p>
      <p>5. Guide us on the straight path upwards</p>
      <p>6. The path of those whom You have favored</p>
      <p>7. But not the path of those who had anger upon them nor of the lost</p>
