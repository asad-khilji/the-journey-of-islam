      <h3>Surah Al Baqarah</h3>
      <p>6. Indeed as for those who disbelieve it is the same for them whether you warn them or do not warn them they will never believe.</p>
      <p>7. Allah has completely sealed their hearts and their hearing and over their eyes is a covering and for them is a great punishment.</p>
      <p>8. And from amongst the people someone says we have believed in Allah and even in the last day No! They are not believers at all.</p>
      <p>9. They attempt to deceive Allah and the believers. They don't deceive anyone except themselves. They have no realization at all.</p>
      <p>10. There is a disease in their hearts. Then Allah has increased them in sickness. And they have a constantly painful punishment because they habitually used to lie.</p>
      <p>11. And when it is said to them do not cause corruption in the area, they say we are only peacemakers.</p>
