      <h3>Surah Al Baqarah</h3>
      <p>6. Indeed as for those who disbelieve it is the same for them whether you warn them or do not warn them they will never believe.</p>
      <p>7. Allah has completely sealed their hearts and their hearing and over their eyes is a covering and for them is a great punishment.</p>
      <p>8. And from amongst the people someone says we have believed in Allah and even in the last day No! They are not believers at all.</p>
      <p>9. They attempt to deceive Allah and the believers. They don't deceive anyone except themselves. They have no realization at all.</p>
      <p>10. There is a disease in their hearts. Then Allah has increased them in sickness. And they have a constantly painful punishment because they habitually used to lie.</p>
      <p>11. And when it is said to them do not cause corruption in the area, they say we are only peacemakers.</p>
      <p>12. So listen up! It is they who are the cause of corruption and they have no realization.</p>
      <p>13. And when it is said to them believe as the people have they said should we believe as the fools have, it is they who are the fools and they know it not.</p>
      <p>14. And when they are with the believers they say we are with you but when they are alone with their devils they say we are with you we were only mocking them.</p>
      <p>15. Allah throws their mockery back at them and prolongs in their transgression as they wander blindly.</p>
      <p>16. Those are the people who have purchased misguidance in exchange for guidance their transaction as brought no profit and they were never committed to guidance at all.</p>
