      <h3>Surah Al Baqarah</h3>
      <p>17. Their example is something like the example of someone who tried to light a fire and when it illuminated everything that was around them Allah took away their light and left them in darkness so they could not see.</p>
      <p>18. Deaf, Mute, and blind so they will not return</p>
      <p>19. Or is it like a rainstorm from the sky with heavy clouds in which there is thunder and lightening, they put their fingers in their ear out of fear of death and Allah is encompassing of the disbelievers</p>
      <p>20. The lightening almost snatches away their eyesight when it lights the way for them they walk a little but when it is dark they stand still and if Allah had willed He would have taken away their hearing and their seeing and Allah is over all things completely capable</p>
