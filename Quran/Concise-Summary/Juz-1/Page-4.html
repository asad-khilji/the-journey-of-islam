      <h3>Surah Al Baqarah</h3>
      <p>17. Their example is something like the example of someone who tried to light a fire and when it illuminated everything that was around them Allah took away their light and left them in darkness so they could not see.</p>
      <p>18. Deaf, Mute, and blind so they will not return</p>
      <p>19. Or is it like a rainstorm from the sky with heavy clouds in which there is thunder and lightening, they put their fingers in their ear out of fear of death and Allah is encompassing of the disbelievers</p>
      <p>20. The lightening almost snatches away their eyesight when it lights the way for them they walk a little but when it is dark they stand still and if Allah had willed He would have taken away their hearing and their seeing and Allah is over all things completely capable</p>
      <p>21. People! Be enslaved to your Master who created you and those much before you so that you may hopefully protect yourselves</p>
      <p>22. It is He who made the earth as a bed spread out and made the sky as a ceiling and sent down from the sky rain providing all kinds of fruits so do not associate partners with Allah while you people know very well</p>
      <p>23. And if you are in any doubt about what We revealed to Our slave then bring a surah like it and call upon all your witnesses other than Allah if you are truthful</p>
      <p>24. Then if you are not able to and you will never be able to then fear the fire whose fuel is men and stones which has been prepared for the disbelievers</p>
