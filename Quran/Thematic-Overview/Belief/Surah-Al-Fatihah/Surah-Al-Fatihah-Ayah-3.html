        <a href="./Surah-Al-Fatihah.html"><h1>Surah Al Fatihah Ayah 3</h1></a>

       <h2>مَالِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ</h2>

       <h3>Introduction</h3>
       <ul>
           <li>The first three ayat of the Fatihah is Allah introducing Himself to us</li>
           <li>Praise and Thanks belongs to Allah because He is Master of People, Ar Rahman, and Ar Raheem</li>
           <li>Praise and Thanks is for Allah because He is Malik Yom Ad Deen</li>
           <li>They are all grammatically connected</li>
       </ul>

       <h3>The Master and The Slave Example</h3>
       <ul>
           <li>There is a Master and a slave</li>
           <li>The Master tells the slave you are free to do anything you want, but just do not cross this fence</li>
           <li>So the slave is hanging around the fence then trips and falls on the other side</li>
           <li>He immediately gets up and the Master sees him and says nothing</li>
           <li>The next day the slave pretends to fall on the other side of the fence</li>
           <li>The Master says nothing</li>
           <li>The next day slave has one foot on one side of he fence and another foot on the other side of the fence</li>
           <li>The Master says nothing</li>
           <li>Years go by and the slave spends all his time on the other side of the fence</li>
           <li>The Master says nothing</li>
           <li>Then one day the Master calls the slave and says remember when I told you not to cross the fence</li>
           <li>The slave says yes I remember</li>
           <li>The Master says I recorded all the times you crossed the fence and I decided to punish now all at once</li>
       </ul>

       <h3>Reality</h3>
       <ul>
           <li>Allah is our Master</li>
           <li>Allah told us this is halal and this is haram</li>
           <li>Human beings accidently slip and fall into sin</li>
           <li>We immediately repent and turn back to Allah</li>
           <li>Then we realize nothing happened and Allah is Ar Rahman and Ar Raheem</li>
           <li>We fall more into sin</li>
           <li>When people advise us to stop sinning, we say its ok Allah is extremely loving and caring</li>
       </ul>

       <h3>Maalik and Malik</h3>
       <ul>
           <li>Maalik means Master or Owner</li>
           <li>An owner owns small things but not big things</li>
           <li>An owner can control every small detail</li>
           <li>Malik means king</li>
           <li>A king owns the entire kingdom</li>
           <li>The king has no control over every small detail</li>
           <li>Allah is the Owner and King of the day of judgment</li>
           <li>On the day of judgment big things will happen, such as the oceans will boil and the mountains will crumble</li>
           <li>Every small deed of the human being will also be counted on the day of Judgment</li>
           <li>Allah takes complete control of judgment day by combining the two names Maalik and Malik</li>
       </ul>

       <h3>Yom</h3>
       <ul>
           <li>Yom means day</li>
           <li>A day is a unit of time</li>
           <li>Human beings can own certain things, but we can never own time</li>
           <li>Allah takes complete ownership of time</li>
           <li>Allah can make a day long like 50,000 years and short like the blink of an eye</li>
           <li>Time is like a bag and we are inside the bag</li>
           <li>Allah owns time and everything inside time</li>
       </ul>

       <h3>Ad Deen</h3>
       <ul>
           <li>Ad Deen means The Judgment</li>
           <li>It means to deal with someone or how you will be dealt with</li>
           <li>Allah will deal with everyone and everything on this day</li>
           <li>It is the completing of the record so we say Alhamdulillah</li>
           <li>Humans beings desire justice especially for other people</li>
           <li>This world is unfair and has no justice</li>
           <li>People do good and a lot of bad is done to them</li>
           <li>People do evil and they seem to get away with it</li>
           <li>Justice will be served on Judgment day</li>
           <li>Nothing you did will go uncounted for</li>
       </ul>
      
       <h3>Love and Care, Punishment, and Justice</h3>
       <ul>
           <li>Think of a number line</li>
           <li>You have positive, neutral, and negative</li>
           <li>Negative is the Punishment of Allah</li>
           <li>Neutral is the Justice of Allah</li>
           <li>Positive is the Love and Care of Allah</li>
           <li>Allah does not compare His Love and Care with His Punishment</li>
           <li>Allah compares His Love and Care with His Justice</li>
           <li>Everything Allah does is postive and neutral, and not negative or any form of punishment</li>
           <li>It is the Justice of Allah that leads people into the hellfire</li>
           <li>It is the Love and Care of Allah that leads people into the paradise</li>
       </ul>

       <h3>Conclusion</h3>
       <ul>
           <li>Allah tells us My slave what has deluded you from Your Generous Master</li>
           <li>You remembered Ar Rahman and Ar Rahmeen, but forgot about Malik Yom Ad Deen</li>
           <li>How can you do that to yourself</li>
       </ul>
