        <a href="./Surah-Al-Fatihah.html"><h1>Surah Al Fatihah Ayah 7</h1></a>

       <h2>غَيْرِ الْمَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا الضَّالِّينَ</h2>

       <h3>But not the Path of those who had wrath upon them</h3>
       <ul>
            <li>Those who had beneficial knowledge but did not act upon it</li>
            <li>These people are found in the past, present, and future</li>
            <li>The Quran gives us a case study of these people through the stories of the Jews, but not all Jews</li>
            <li>Allah, the angels, and the believers are angry at them</li>
            <li>These people lead other people to become lost because they look to them for knowledge</li>
            <li>They increase more wrongdoing in the world</li>
       </ul>

       <h3>Nor of the lost</h3>
       <ul>
            <li>Those who did not have beneficial knowledge and acted wrongly</li>
            <li>These people are found in the past, present, and future</li>
            <li>The Quran gives us a case study of these through the stories of the Christians, but not all Christians</li>
            <li>The guidance is there available for them but they choose not to know</li>
       </ul>

       <h3>Example</h3>
       <ul>
            <li>I have two sons Imad and Waleed</li>
            <li>Both Imad and Waleed are looking at the cookies</li>
            <li>I am about to go upstairs to take a phone call</li>
            <li>I leave Imad in charge and tell him not to eat the cookies</li>
            <li>Waleed cannot eat them either, but i left Imad in charge and told him not to eat it</li>
            <li>When I come back I see Imad and Waleed eating the cookies</li>
            <li>I am angry at Imad because I told him not to eat the cookies</li>
            <li>I am not that angry at Waleed, but I still hold him responsible</li>
            <li>Waleed should have asked me not Imad</li>
       </ul>
