            <li>Who remember Allah while standing, sitting, or lying on their sides</li>
            <li>And those who give thought to the creation of the heavens and the earth</li>
            <li>Saying Our Master You did not create this aimlessly</li>
            <li>How Perfect are You above such a thing</li>

            <li>There are no helpers</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Ayah 193</h3>

            <li>Our Master forgive us and remove from us our misdeeds</li>

            <li>Never will I allow to be lost the work of any among you whether male or female</li>
            <li>So those who emigrated or were evicted fron their homes</li>
            <li>Or were harmed in My cause or killed</li>
            <li>I will surely remove from them their misdeeds</li>
            <li>And I will surely admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow</li>

            <li>It is but a small enjoyment</li>

        </ul>

    <h3>Ayah 198</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>But those who feared their Master will have gardens beneath which rivers flow</li>
            <li>Abiding therein eternally as an accomodation from Allah</li>
            <li>And that which is with Allah is the best for the righteous</li>
        </ul>

            <li>And what was revealed to you and what was revealed to them being humbly submissive to Allah</li>
            <li>They do not exchange the ayat of Allah for a small price</li>
            <li>those will have their reward with their Master</li>
            <li>Indeed Allah is swift in account</li>
