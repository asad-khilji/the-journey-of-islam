       <h3>Ayah 35</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Allah is the light of the heavens and the earth</li>
            <li>The example of His light is like a niche within which is a lamp</li>
            <li>The lamp is within a glass</li>
            <li>The glass as if it were a pearly white star lit from a blessed olive tree</li>
            <li>Neither of the east or the west</li>
            <li>Whose oil would amost glow even if untouched by fire,</li>
            <li>Light upon Light</li>
            <li>Allah guides to His light whom He wills</li>
            <li>And Allah presents examples to the people</li>
            <li>And Allah is knowing of all things</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Ayah 36</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Such niches are in houses which Allah has ordered to be raised</li>
            <li>And that His name be mentioned therein</li>
            <li>Exalting Him within them in the morning and in the evening</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h3>Ayah 37</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>True Men are those whom neither commerce nor sale distracts them from the remebrance of Allah</li>
            <li>And performance of prayer and giving zakah</li>
            <li>They fear a day in which the hearts and eyes will fearfully turn about</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Ayah 38</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>That Allah may reward them according to the best of what they did</li>
            <li>And increase them from His bounty</li>
            <li>And Allah gives provision to whom He wills without account</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Ayah 39</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>But those who disbelieved their deeds are like a miraj in a lowland</li>
            <li>In which a thristy one thinks is water until when he comes to it, he finds it is nothing</li>
            <li>But he finds Allah before him</li>
            <li>Allah will pay him in full his dues</li>
            <li>And Allah is swift in account</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Ayah 40</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Or they are like darknesses within an unfathomable sea</li>
            <li>Which is covered by waves upon which are waves over which are clouds</li>
            <li>Darkness upon darkness</li>
            <li>When one puts out his hand, he can hardly see it</li>
            <li>And he to whom Allah has not granted light, for him there is no light</li>
        </ul>
