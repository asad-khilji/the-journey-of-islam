        <a href="../Overview/Overview.html"><h1>Surah Al Asr</h1></a>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Surah Al Asr is the summary of the entire Quran</li>
            <li>This surah is the minumum Allah expects from us</li>
            <li>This surah contains three ayat but one sentence</li>
        </ul>
            
     <h3>Allah takes an Oath</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Allah swears by time</li>
            <li>To get your attention</li>
            <li>To prepare you for the subject of the oath</li>
            <li>When Allah is angry</li>
            <li>When Allah is not being believed</li>
            <li>Swear is used as a testimony in court</li>
            <li>To give you evidence</li>
            <li>To describe a witness</li>
            <li>Time is like an old man who is a witness to how mankind has been in loss</li>
            <li>Time is the greatest witness that humans beings are in loss</li>
            <li>Time is a witness to a lot of the same things</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Human Beings are in loss</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>For sure each and every human being is drowning in loss</li>
                    <li>Time is like a sense of urgency that is always running out and being squeezed out of us</li>
                    <li>Time is the ultimate proof that we are in loss</li>
                    <li>We do not think about anyone else but yourself</li>
                    <li>We are truly ourselves when we are alone</li>
                    <li>We must first realize who we truly are and that we are in loss</li>
                    <li>Allah said we are in some loss and not total loss</li>
                </ul>

       <h3>The Four Parts of Surah Asr</h3>
        <ol>        
            <li>Except for those who believe</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Imagine you are drowning and asleep</li>
                    <li>The first thing you need to do is wake and realize you are drowning in loss</li>
                    <li>The first thing to believe is that you are drowning in loss</li>
                    <li>It is a small group of people who believe and acquire the other four qualities</li>
                    <li>They believe in Allah, the angels, the books, the Messengers, the last day, destiny the good and bad</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Those who do good deeds</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The next step is to do good actions that save you from drowning</li>
                    <li>Prove your belief with your actions</li>
                    <li>Deeds that fix your day</li>
                    <li>Just doing a few handful of good deeds</li>
                    <li>Deeds that are less than ten</li>
                    <li>Allah is not asking us for a lot</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Those who counsel each other truthfully</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Then you realize you are tied to your relative</li>
                    <li>You must wake them up and help each other to survive</li>
                    <li>Counsel each other truthfully</li>
                    <li>This deen is not just about ourselves</li>
                    <li>We must take care of others</li>
                    <li>Find the right time and words to give counsel</li>
                    <li>Giving heart felt advice and soften their heart</li>
                    <li>You are giving advice and also willing to receive advice</li>
                    <li>Counseling truthfully and sincerly</li>
                    <li>It takes great courage and strength to speak the truth</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Those who counsel each other patiently</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>You must continue to preserve and encourage each other to keep going</li>
                    <li>Or else you both will drown in loss and die</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
    </ol> 

    <h3>Concluding Remarks</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The last ayah of the surah is in the past tense</li>
            <li>Our role models are found in the past</li>
