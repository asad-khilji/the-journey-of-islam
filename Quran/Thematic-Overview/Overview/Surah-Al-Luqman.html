        <a href="../Overview/Overview.html"><h1>Surah Al Luqman</h1></a>

    <h3>Ayah 12</h3> 
        <ul>
            <li>And We definitely gave Luqman wisdom so that he might be grateful to Allah</li>
            <li>And we definitely gave Luqman wisdom so that he was grateful for the sake of Allah</li>
            <li>There is a time and place to speak to everyone! Luqman (A) spoke to his son when the right time came</li>
            <li>Part of being a wise person is that you find something to be grateful for in every situation that you are in</li>
            <li>Belief in Allah doesn’t just mean belief in the entity, the being that is Allah. 
            <li>It leads to certain kinds of attitudes</li>
            <li>The first of these attitudes is gratitude, positivity and appreciation that lead to your mentality shifting.</li>
            <li>Allah says whoever is grateful is grateful for himself</li>
            <li>And whoever is ungrateful then the punishment is severe</li>
            <li>Allah doesn’t need people to praise Him!</li>
            <li>If there was no creation, if nothing had ever been made to praise Him He would still be worthy of praise</li>
            <li>It is part of His quality of being Al Hameed</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Ayah 13</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>And when Luqman said to his son while he was giving him loving advice: come here young son, don’t associate anyone with Allah</li>
            <li>There is a time and place to speak to everyone! Luqman (A) spoke to his son when the right time came</li>
            <li>Luqman gave advice to his son in a meaningful loving and caring way</li>
            <li>Luqman chose to part his advice at this time and tries to impact his son emotionally</li>
            <li>Luqman calls his son in a loving way to reduce stress and feelings of harshness</li>
            <li>He said come here my dear son as opposed to come here son</li>
            <li>The first part of advice is to be good to Allah and to not associate any partner with Him</li>
            <li>Ibn Taymiyyah categorized our slavery to Allah as such:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>We Pray to Him</li>
                    <li>We Obey Him</li>
                    <li>We Trust Him</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This trust is unique because Allah does not have to earn it</li>
                            <li>We already rely on Allah on everything such as our breathing and our heart beat</li>
                            <li>Other people in life can and always will let you down in some way but Allah never will</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>We Love Him</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Your heart has to be tied to Allah</li>
                            <li>You cannot allow something to distract you in times of worship</li>
                            <li>If Allah is truly in your heart than your thought will be on Him and not on other things</li>
                            <li>If our love for our family, friends, and obligations is not based on our love for Allah than it can be a form of shirk</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Allah decides the terms of the relationship not you or me</li>
                </ol>
        </ul>

    <h3>Ayah 14</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>And We have enjoined upon man [care] for his parents.</li>
            <li>His mother carried him, [increasing her] in weakness upon weakness,</li>
            <li>And his weaning is in two years</li>
            <li>Be grateful to Me and to your parents; to Me is the [final] destination</li>
            <li>Allah (swt) mentions being grateful to Him, and then brings up our parents first</li>
            <li>Because He protects us, feeds us, gives us what we need to survive, He teaches us - all of this through our parents</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Ayah 15</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>But if they strive to make you take partners with Me then do not obey them but keep good company with them</li>
            <li>A lot of times we feel like our parents are pushing us to something that’s bad and we can stop spending time with them</li>
            <li>But Allah (swt) says we HAVE to spend more time with them in an excellent manner</li>
            <li>Remain in their company decently, friendly, respectfully, and in service to them</li>
            <li>There is a 99% chance that you, the child, are being entitled or arrogant, so make sure you ALWAYS act in the best way to them.</li>
            <li>And follow the path of whoever turned back to Me</li>
            <li>If you aren’t able to use your parents as mentors, find people who turn back to Allah</li>
            <li>Find people who make you want to be better and emulate them</li>
            <li>Then I will inform you of the things you used to do</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Ayah 16</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>And Luqman said O my son indeed if a wrong should be the weight of a mustard seed</li>
            <li>And it should be within a rock or anywhere in the heavens or in the earth</li>
            <li>Allah will bring it forth</li>
            <li>Indeed Allah is Subtle and Acquainted</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Ayah 17</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>O my son establish the prayer and enjoin what is right</li>
            <li>Forbid what is wrong and be patient over what befalls you</li>
            <li>Indeed all that is of the matters requiring determination</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h3>Ayah 18</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>And do not turn your cheek in contempt toward people</li>
            <li>And do not walk through the earth exultantly</li>
            <li>Indeed Allah does not like everyone self-deluded and boastful</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Ayah 19</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>And be moderate in your pace and lower your voice</li>
            <li>Indeed the most disagreeable of sounds is the voice of donkeys</li>
        </ul>
