    <h3>Introduction</h3> 
        <ul>
            <li>Surah Al Baqarah begins with talking about three groups of people believers, disbelievers, and hypocrites</li>
            <li>Then it mentions the story of Adam and lessons on controlling our greed</li>
            <li>Then it mentions the favors Allah bestowed upon the Children of Israel but they were ungrateful</li>
            <li>Then Allah mentions the favors allah bestowed upon Ibrahim and he was grateful</li>
            <li>Ibrahim had raised the foundations of the Kaaba with his son Ismael</li>
            <li>Then Allah changed the direction of prayer from Jersalem to Makkah so the Prophet is happy</li>
            <li>Ramadan is the inauguration month of a new nation for Muslims.</li>
            <li>Previously Muslims had prayed in the same direction as the Jews, and fasted at the same times</li>
            <li>With the revelation of the Quran, the Muslims now had their own book, their own capital (Makkah), and their own set of religious requirements</li>
            <li>As part of this inauguration, Allah redefines what the definition of a good person is in Surah Al-Baqarah:177</li>
        </ul>
      
    <h3>Who is a Good Person?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The word goodness or birr is related to the word barr or land because goodness is like safety on land</li>
            <li>Whereas sin is like an ocean in which you are drowning in loss</li>
            <li>Also, land is firm, just as the definition of Goodness is firm</li>
            <li>Even as our cultures and situations change, our definition of goodness remains fixed</li>
            <li>Its important to note that this discussion is about the highest level of goodness</li>
            <li>If a person doesn’t meet these requirements, it doesn’t mean that they don’t do anything good;</li>
            <li>It just means that they haven’t reached the highest level of goodness as Allah defines it</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h3>What is required to be Goodness?</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To Believe in Allah</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is important to note that this is the first pre requiste to goodness</li>
                </ul>
            <li>To Believe in the Last Day and that you will be held accountable for your deeds</li>
            <li>To Believe in the Angels, Books, and Messengers</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is the order of revelation</li>
                    <li>The angels delivered the books to the Messengers</li>
                    <li>And the Messengers delivered the message to us</li>
                    <li>Without revelation we would not know what goodness is</li>
                </ul>
            <li>To Believe in Destiny, the good and the bad</li>
            <li>To Give Charity Despite your Love of Wealth</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Giving to those closest to you such as relatives and friends</li>
                    <li>Giving to the orphans</li>
                    <li>Giving to the Poor</li>
                    <li>Giving to the travelers and competing to host them in your house</li>
                    <li>Giving to help someone crushed under debt, paying off student loans, or freeing a slave</li>
                </ul>
            <li>To Establish Salah</li>

                    <li>It is symbolic for all deeds we do for Allah</li>
                </ul>
            <li>To Give Zakah</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is symbolic for all deeds we do for other people</li>
