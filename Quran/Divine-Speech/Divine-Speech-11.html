       <h3>Why Allah uses We in the Quran to describe Himself</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Allah uses the pronouns I, You, We, and He to describe Himself</li>
                <li>The pronoun We is not used consistently</li>
                <li>You is only used when we make dua to Allah</li>
                <li>Allah speaking on His own behalf He uses I, We, and He</li>
                <li>I and We are close</li>
                <li>He is far away</li>
                <li>I is used in extreme anger or extreme love and it is close</li>
                <li>The pronoun He is formal and distant</li>
                <li>The pronoun We is used to describe the majesty of Allah</li>
                <li>It is the royal We</li>
                <li>The pronoun We is used to describe the grandeur of Allah</li>
                <li>With water you find manifestation of Allah's gifts</li>
                <li>We is used for Allah's grand gifts for us</li>
                <li>The pronoun We is immediately followed by a singular attribute of Allah</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>The Example of the fly</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Those who you worship other than Allah will never be able to create a single fly</li>
                <li>Even if you all got together to create a fly, they will never be able to create it</li>
                <li>Even if you catch the fly you can never get back what it stole from you</li>
                <li>People leave food in front of the idol</li>
                <li>The idol does not eat the food</li>
                <li>If there is a fly it takes food and flies away </li>
                <li>You or the idol can never get that food or drink back that it stole</li>
                <li>The foundations of their faith is destroyed by one fly</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>The seeker and the sought are both inherently weak</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The idol and the one being worshipped is weak</li>
                <li>The polytheist and the one worshipping is weak</li>
                <li>When you seek Allah then you will be strong</li>
                <li>Allah is the most strong</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Surah Al Hadid Ayah 20</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>You have better come to know that worldly life amounts to nothing more than</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Play</li>
                        <li>Entertainment</li>
                        <li>Beatification</li>
                        <li>Showing off what you accomplished</li>
                        <li>Savings in terms to wealth and children</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>You worked so hard to earn it then you watch it turn yellow</li>
                <li>Like a farmer that sees rain after working the garden so hard</li>
                <li>Instead of picking it he watches it turn yellow</li>
                <li>All things above come and go</li>
                <li>In the end the only thing that remains is forgiveness from Allah</li>
                <li>And contentment from Allah or punishment</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>What will women get in Jannah</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Both men and women will get what they deserve</li>
                <li>Each will be happy with what we have</li>
                <li>Allah made a list for what men will get</li>
                <li>Allah did not make the same list for women</li>
                <li>Because women are different</li>
                <li>Men are all the same</li>
            </ul>
