                        <li>I swear by time</li>
                        <li>What ever you are swearing by</li>
                        <li>It becomes evidence for the subject of the oath</li>
                        <li>It prepares you for the subject of the oath</li>

        <h3>The Orange Sky</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Allah swears by the orange sky</li>
                <li>And by the night as it becomes dark</li>
                <li>And by the moon as it goes through stages</li>
                <li>We will rise one stage after the rest</li>
                <li>When the sky is orange it is Maghreb time</li>
                <li>Maghreb is inevitable </li>
                <li>The sky is orange but we know what coming and the night is coming</li>
                <li>The colors change from orange to blue to black</li>
                <li>After its black the moon comes out and the moon goes through stages</li>
                <li>One thing to another and the process repeats itself</li>
                <li>This same way we will also move from one stage to another</li>
                <li>We were in the world of souls then the womb of our mothers</li>
                <li>Then in this world then in the grave then on the day of judgment</li>
                <li>Then finally in Jannah</li>
                <li>If we ever forget about our journey just look at the orange sky</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Surah Al Adiyat</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Allah swears by horses getting ready into battle</li>
                <li>Female horses who are faster and more aggressive</li>
                <li>There are less than 10 horses riding super fast</li>
                <li>They are riding and panting</li>
                <li>Then you see sparks fly whenever the horseshoe hits the rock</li>
                <li>Even though the rocks have water on them</li>
                <li>Then these horses ride into the morning light</li>
                <li>As a result of the horses running fast a cloud of dust rises</li>
                <li>Then they penetrate the lines of the forces</li>
                <li>And they get right into the middle of the army</li>
                <li>Indeed mankind is ungrateful to His Master</li>
                <li>Allah stopped the movie and continued with the subject of the oath</li>
                <li>Animals run from danger yet these horses are loyal to its master and runs into death</li>
                <li>Allah is saying we also have a Master but we are not so loyal</li>
                <li>Allah uses what we know to teach us a lesson</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Examples</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A teacher gives an example to make the subject easier to understand for its students</li>
                <li>A good example is easy to follow</li>
                <li>A good example is relatable</li>
                <li>A good example leads you to the point</li>
                <li>A good example brings you back to the lesson</li>
                <li>Allah gives us the best examples in the Quran</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Surah Al Hajj</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>People who are solely dedicated to Allah and do not commit shirk</li>
                <li>Those who commit shirk is like one who is falling from the sky</li>
                <li>And birds are eating from his flesh</li>
                <li>And the wind blows him away to an unchartered location</li>
                <li>These people do not have any concept of the afterlife</li>
                <li>These people also want to be remembered so they try to leave a legacy</li>
                <li>The Ancient Arabs wanted to live on through the legend of their fight skills</li>
                <li>Two tribes are going into battle</li>
                <li>One tribe is on top of the mountain and the other tribe is on the bottom</li>
                <li>The tribe on the bottom reached the top and defeated the tribe on top</li>
                <li>Then they threw their body off the mountain and birds ate from their flesh</li>
                <li>Then the wind blew them to an unchartered location, never to be remembered</li>
                <li>Some people on top had a choice to die from the enemies sword or jump off a mountain</li>
                <li>So they died the death of a loser or the death of a coward</li>
                <li>Their family disowned them so the vultures ate from them</li>
                <li>Then the winds blow the rest of the remains away</li>
                <li>The humiliation of falling from the sky</li>
                <li>The humiliation of birds eating from your corpse</li>
                <li>The humiliation of being blown away to an unchartered location </li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Three Types of Hearts in Surah Baqarah</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Then your hearts became hard</li>
                <li>Or even harder than stone</li>
                <li>There are stones that explode and rivers gush out of them</li>
                <li>And even out of stones there are those that crack open and some water comes out</li>
                <li>Out of stones there are those that fall from the fear of Allah</li>
                <li>Hearts are being compared to rocks</li>
                <li>The three types of hearts</li>
                <li>The three types of hearts</li>
                <li>The hearts of introverts, extroverts, and the common folk</li>
                <li>People have different personalities</li>
                <li>Sahaba were different in this way as well like Abu Bakr and Umar</li>
                <li>Rocks are compared to hearts and water is compared to faith</li>
                <li>Some hearts rush with faith immediately, the hearts of Ihsan</li>
                <li>Some hearts flow with imaan after being shaken up, the hearts of imaan</li>
                <li>Some hearts just fall from the fear of Allah without true faith, the hearts of Islam</li>
            </ul>
