        <h3>Misran and Misra</h3>
        <ul>
                <li>Misran means countryiside</li>
                <li>Misra means Egypt</li>
                <li>The children of Israel are in the desert and they are tired of eating only manna and salwa</li>
                <li>The children of Israel tell Musa to ask Allah for cucumbers, lentils, and onions</li>
                <li>Musa said do you seek something inferior for what is better</li>
                <li>Musa said go to Egypt I mean countryside you will get what you are asking for</li>
                <li>This is the saracasm of Musa</li>
                <li>The food they asked for was what they were given in Egypt</li>
                <li>They missed that food it is as if they missed slavery in Egypt</li>
                <li>Those that went to Misran were slapped with humiliation, they were stuck, and they recieved rage from Allah</li>
           </ul>

           <h3>Musa and Isa</h3>
           <ul>
                   <li>To be from a nation your father has to be from that nation</li>
                   <li>Musa had a father so he addresses his people as My People</li>
                   <li>Isa did not have a father so he addresses his people as Israel</li>
                   <li>Isa never says in the Quran my people</li>
              </ul>
