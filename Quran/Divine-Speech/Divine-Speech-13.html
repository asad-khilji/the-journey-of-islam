      <h3>Surah Al Shu ara Ayah 9-68</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>No doubt about it Your Master truly He is the ultimate authority</li>
                <li>And he is always loving and caring</li>
                <li>Allah's authority will manifest against the Pharoah and his army</li>
                <li>Allah's love and care will be on the side of Musa</li>
                <li>When Your Master made a call to Musa to go to the wrong doing nation</li>
                <li>Musa is now being called by Allah on top of the mountain</li>
                <li>The nation of the Pharoah, don't they have any fear</li>
                <li>But Musa is a fugitive or ran away from Egypt and he is wanted for murder</li>
                <li>Look at the irony here</li>
                <li>When Musa left he made sure not a single person saw him</li>
                <li>When Musa needs to return to Egypt he must be seen by every single person</li>
                <li>This is the responsibility Allah gives to Musa</li>
                <li>Musa said O My Master Indeed I fear that they will call me a liar</li>
                <li>My Chest becomes tight because I get angry</li>
                <li>My tongue stops moving and I have a stutter</li>
                <li>And they have a crime against me</li>
                <li>Send Harun instead</li>
                <li>Allah said No problem both of you go with Our signs, indeed We are with you listening</li>
                <li>Allah addresses all of these concerns of Musa with one word and tells him to go now</li>
                <li>First Allah took care of all his conerns, then He gave him miracles, and sent with him Harun too</li>
                <li>Allah also sends angels with them as well</li>
                <li>Allah is listening to Musa, Harun, and Pharoah carefully</li>
                <li>Allah is telling us He listened to this conversation carefully so what about us</li>
                <li>We must listen to this conversation carefully as well</li>
                <li>So both of you go and say to Pharoah We are the Messenger of the Master of all People</li>
                <li>Musa and Harun has to go straight to Pharoah</li>
                <li>Both Musa and Harun are inseparable</li>
                <li>Musa might go inside and Harun might be held back</li>
                <li>But Musa ensures both are inseparable</li>
                <li>So both Musa and Harun go to see the Pharoah</li>
                <li>That send with us the Children of Israel</li>
                <li>Allah skips scene and goes from the conversation on the mountain straight to the Pharoah in the palace</li>
                <li>Musa is on the mountain speaking with Allah</li>
                <li>Then he meets with Harun</li>
                <li>Then they head out to Egypt</li>
                <li>Then they speak with the guards</li>
                <li>The guards let Musa in not Harun but Harun says he is with me</li>
                <li>The guards tell them let him in</li>
                <li>Musa and Harun go in</li>
                <li>Musa asks Pharoah and the Pharoah replies</li>
                <li>Allah skips this whole scene</li>
                <li>The Pharoah said did I not raise you as a child for so many years?</li>
                <li>And you did your deed that you did the pharoah did not expose Musa</li>
                <li>How can you be ungrateful?</li>
                <li>Musa asked the Pharoah but the Pharoah changed the topic and asked Musa instead to distract him</li>
                <li>Musa stays focused and does not get angry or tongue tied</li>
                <li>Musa replies back to Pharoah confidently and comes back to the main topic</li>
                <li>Musa said I did it when I was of those who are lost and Musa does not expose himself</li>
                <li>So I fled from all of you when I was afraid of you</li>
                <li>Then My Master made me a Messenger</li>
                <li>And is this a favor upon me that you enslaved te children of Israel</li>
                <li>The Pharoah gets angry and responds and says what Master of the People</li>
                <li>Musa says The Master of he heavens and the earth and all that is between them</li>
                <li>This statement brings down the whole religion of Pharoah</li>
                <li>Because Pharoah believes the Nile river runs under his feet</li>
                <li>The Pharoah gets angry and says to his close assembly do you not hear at what he said</li>
                <li>Musa remains calm and says Your Master and the Master of your forefathers</li>
                <li>The Pharoah said Indeed your Messenger sent to you is truly mad</li>
                <li>The Pharoah gets angry, dismisses Musa, and calls him mad</li>
                <li>But Musa remains calm and on point</li>
                <li>Musa said the Master of the east and west and whatever is between them don't you think</li>
                <li>The Pharoah said If you take a god other than me I will surely imprison you</li>
                <li>Musa said even if I bring to you clear proof</li>
                <li>The Pharoah said then bring your proof if you are truthful</li>
                <li>So Musa threw his staff and it turned into a giant snake</li>
                <li>And Musa put his hand in his shirt and it came out white</li>
                <li>The Pharoah said to his close chiefs indeed Musa is just a learned magician</li>
                <li>He wants to drive you out of your land so what do you advise</li>
                <li>The Pharoah appealed to thei sense of emotions and won over their hearts</li>
                <li>For the first time the Pharoah called Egypt their land and asked for their advice</li>
                <li>His chiefs said to Pharoah post pone him and his brother and send out to the cities gatherers</li>
                <li>To plan for a big dependance day</li>
                <li>They brought to Pharoah every learned magician</li>
                <li>And they made an assembly to a well known day</li>
                <li>And it was said to the people will you congregate</li>
                <li>The people were beginning to think that the magicians were more powerful then the pharoah</li>
                <li>The magicians knew that and took advantage of the situation</li>
                <li>The magicians asked the pharoah will we get paid</li>
                <li>So pharoah said yes you will be brought close to me</li>
                <li>Instead of cutting off their leg and giving it back to him as a payment</li>
                <li>On the day of the assembly the magicians threw their staff and it became serpents</li>
                <li>Then Musa threw his staff and it became a giant snake that ate their trick</li>
                <li>The magicians went straight into prostration</li>
                <li>The Pharoah thought they were praising him</li>
                <li>The magicians got up and said We believe in the Master of all People</li>
                <li>The pharoah thought it was him and said yes I know</li>
                <li>Then the magicians said the Master of Musa and Harun</li>
