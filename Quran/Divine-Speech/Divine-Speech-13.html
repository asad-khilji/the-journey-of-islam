      <h3>Surah Al Shu ara</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Ta. Sin. Mim</li>
            <li>These are the ayat of the clear book</li>
            <li>Perhaps you would kill yourself with grief that they will not be believers</li>
            <li>If We willed, We could send down to them from the sky a sign for which their necks would remain humbled</li>
            <li>And no revelation comes to them anew from Ar Rahman except that they turn away from it</li>
            <li>For they have already denied, but there will come to them the news of that which they used to ridicule</li>
            <li>Did they not look at the earth how much We have produced therein from every noble kind?</li>
            <li>Indeed in that is a sign, but most of them were not to be believers</li>
            <li>And indeed Your Master He is the Exalted in Might, The Always Loving and Caring</li>
            <li>And mention when Your Master called Musa saying go to the wrongdoing people</li>
            <li>The people of the Pharoah, don't they have any fear</li>
            <li>He said My Master indeed i fear that they will deny me</li>
            <li>And that my chest will tighten and my tongue will not be fluent, so send for Harun</li>
            <li>And they have upon me a claim dur to sin, so I fear that they will kill me</li>
            <li>Allah said No problem go both of you with Our signs indeed We are with you listening</li>
            <li>Go to Pharoah and say We are the Messenger of the Master of all people</li>
            <li>And send with us the children of Israel</li>
            <li>Pharoah said Did we not raise you among as a child and you remained among us for years of your life</li>
            <li>And then you did your deed that you did and you were of the ungrateful</li>
            <li>Musa said I did it then when I was of those who were lost</li>
            <li>So I fled from you when I feared you then My Master granted me wisdom and prophethood and appointed me as one of the messengers</li>
            <li>And this is the favor of which you remind me that you enslaved the Children of Israel</li>
            <li>Pharoah said And what Master of the people</li>
            <li>Musa said The Master of the heavens and the earth and that which is between them if you should be convinced</li>
            <li>Pharoah said to those around him Do you not hear?</li>
            <li>Musa said Your Master and the Master of your first forefathers</li>
            <li>Pharoah said indeed your messenger who has been sent to you is mad</li>
            <li>Musa said Master of the east and the west and that between them if you were to reason</li>
            <li>Pharoah said If you take a god other than me I will surely place you among those imprisoned</li>
            <li>Musa said Even if I brought you clear proof</li>
            <li>Pharoah said then bring your proof if you are truthful</li>
            <li>So Musa threw his staff and it became a giant snake</li>
            <li>And he drew out his hand thereupon it was white for the observers</li>
            <li>Pharoah said to the eminent ones around him Indeed this is a learned magician</li>
            <li>He wants to drive you out of your land by his magic, so what do you advise</li>
            <li>They said Postpone the matter of him and his brother and send among the cities gatherers</li>
            <li>Who will bring you every learned and skilled magician</li>
            <li>So the magicians were assembled for the appointment of a well known day</li>
            <li>And it was said to the people Will you congregate</li>
            <li>That we might follow the magicians if they are the predominant</li>
            <li>And when the magicians arrived they said Paharoah Is there indeed for us a reward if we are the predominant</li>
            <li>He said yes and indeed you will be of those near to me</li>
            <li>Musa said to them throw whatever you will throw</li>
            <li>So they threw their ropes and their staffs and said By the might of Pharoah indeed it is we who are predominant</li>
            <li>Then Musa threw his staff and at once it devoured what they falsified</li>
            <li>So the magicians fell into prostration</li>
            <li>They said We have believed in the Master of all people</li>
            <li>The Master of Musa and Harun</li>
            <li>Pharoah said You believed Musa before I gave you permission. Indeed he is your teacher who has taught you magic but you are going to know. I will surely cut off your hands and your feet on opposites sides and I will crucify you all.</li>
            <li>They said No harm Indeed to our Master we will return</li>
            <li>Indeed we aspire that our Master will forgive us because we were the first of the believers</li>
            <li>And We inspired to Musa Travel by night with My slaves indeed you will be pursued</li>
            <li>Then Pharoah sent among the cities gatherers</li>
            <li>And said Indeed those are but a small band</li>
            <li>And indeed they are enraging us</li>
            <li>And indeed we are a cautious society</li>
            <li>So we removed them from gardens and springs</li>
            <li>And treasures and honorable station</li>
            <li>And we caused to inherit it the Children of Israel</li>
            <li>So they pursed them at sunrise</li>
            <li>And when the two companies saw one another the companions of Musa said Indeed we are to be overtaken</li>
            <li>Musa said No Indeed with me is my Master He will guide me</li>
            <li>Then We inspired to Musa strike with your staff the sea and it parted and each portion was like a great towering mountain</li>
            <li>And We saved Musa and those with him all together</li>
            <li>Then We drowned the others</li>
            <li>Indeed in that is a sign but most of them were not to be believers</li>
            <li>And indeed Your Master He is the exalted in might the always loving and caring</li>
