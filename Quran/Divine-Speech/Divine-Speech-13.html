      <h3>Surah Al Shu ara</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Ta. Sin. Mim</li>
            <li>These are the ayat of the clear book</li>
            <li>Perhaps you would kill yourself with grief that they will not be believers</li>
            <li>If We willed, We could send down to them from the sky a sign for which their necks would remain humbled</li>
            <li>And no revelation comes to them anew from Ar Rahman except that they turn away from it</li>
            <li>For they have already denied, but there will come to them the news of that which they used to ridicule</li>
            <li>Did they not look at the earth how much We have produced therein from every noble kind?</li>
            <li>Indeed in that is a sign, but most of them were not to be believers</li>
            <li>And indeed Your Master He is the Exalted in Might, The Always Loving and Caring</li>
            <li>And mention when Your Master called Musa saying go to the wrongdoing people</li>
            <li>The people of the Pharoah, don't they have any fear</li>
        </ol>
