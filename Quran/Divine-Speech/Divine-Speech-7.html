        <a href="../Divine-Speech/Divine-Speech.html"><h1>Sequencing in the Quran</h1></a>

        <h3>Surah Al Mulk</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Say He is Ar Rahman we have believed in him and upon Him we rely</li>
            <li>There is a strange re arrangment of the words in this ayah</li>
            <li>One part of the ayah is in normal ordering</li>
            <li>The other part of the ayah is in a different order</li>
            <li>When you change the order this way the word only is added to the meaning</li>
            <li>We believe in Allah and only upon Allah we rely</li>
            <li>We believe in Allah, the angels, the books, the Messengers, The last day, and qadr</li>
            <li>We only rely upon Allah and no one else</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Quran as Speech</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Quran was presented to the people as speech</li>
            <li>When you say something it is said and done</li>
            <li>The first version is perfect until today</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Surah Al Kahf</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>How well He sees and well He hears</li>
            <li>The ayah is talking about Allah</li>
            <li>Allah mentions hearing first then seeing second</li>
            <li>In this ayah Allah mentions seeing first then hearing second</li>
            <li>In this ayah and another ayah the pattern is broken and seeing is mentioned first then hearing</li>
            <li>This ayah is about the people of the cave and how no one could see them</li>
            <li>Allah wanted to highlight how well Allah sees because no one else could see them</li>
            <li>Then Allah mentions how well He hears because Allah records a private conversation between friends</li>
            <li>The Quran has its unique perspective on history</li>
            <li>We are getting Allah's perspective on history</li>
            <li>Allah mentions what He thinks is important for us in the history lesson</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Surah Anaam and Surah Isra</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Do not kill your children out of fear of poverty, We provide for them and you</li>
            <li>Do not kill your children because of poverty, We provide for you and them</li>
            <li>One person is not expierencing poverty but afraid of falling into poverty</li>
            <li>Another person is expierencing poverty</li>
            <li>Allah mentions that He provides for you first because you are poor</li>
            <li>Allah mentions that He provides for your children first because you are not poor</li>
            <li>These two ayat are in two different surahs and revealed at two different times</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Sealing the Hearts and Hearing</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>In Surah Baqarah Allah mentions that He sealed your heart, hearing, and eyes</li>
            <li>In Surah Jathiya Allah mentions that He sealed your hearing first and heart second</li>
            <li>Surah Baqarah has to do with matters of the heart such as taqwa, guidance, imaan, doubt</li>
            <li>Surah Jathiya has to do with matters of listening to the guidance</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Surah Al Jumuah</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>When they say business and entertainment and left you standing there during khutba</li>
            <li>The remembrance of Allah is better than Entertainment and business</li>
            <li>The main reason people left the khutba in that time was business</li>
            <li>So Allah mentioned business first and entertainment second</li>
            <li>In the next ayah Allah switches the sequences and mentions entertainment first and business second</li>
            <li>Because most people get distracted from Jummuah from entertainment</li>
            <li>There is a specific instance and a universal instance</li>
            <li>Not everyone will be involved in business but everyone will be involved in entertainment</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Ayat ul Birr</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Being good isn't only that you turn your faces to the east or west</li>
            <li>Most of the ayah is saying what it means to be good</li>
            <li>Allah made a transition from the conversation about prayer than what else goodness is about</li>
            <li>Allah describes what makes a person good and lists a few things</li>
            <li>Allah lists those who pray, give zakah, and spend on close relatives and poor</li>
            <li>Out of all those things Allah highlights patience</li>
            <li>Because all these qualities can only be good if you are patiently constant with it</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Example</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>You are about to do the groceries and your wife gives you a list</li>
            <li>She says get the milk una, get the carrots una, and get the diapers eena</li>
            <li>Everything on the list is said same way except one thing which is most important of all</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Ayat ul Kursi</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>His kursi held the skies and the earth</li>
            <li>Held meaning it held it before and the maximum capacity was not reached</li>
            <li>Allah used a word that indicates it is a matter of fact and not just a potential</li>
            <li>The distance between the 7 skies is like a ring in the desert</li>
            <li>The size of the kursi compared to the 7 sevens is like a ring in the desert</li>
            <li>Allah says My love and care encompasses all things</li>
        </ul>
