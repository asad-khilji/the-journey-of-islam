        <a href="../Divine-Speech/Divine-Speech.html"><h1>The Quran is in Perfect Order</h1></a>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>All we can do with the word of Allah is ponder, wonder, inquire, and try to find meaning</li>
            <li>Whatever we conclude we have to say Allah knows best</li>
            <li>Every ayah of the Quran is like an ocean</li>
            <li>When you pull out a gem one person thinks this is what makes the Quran amazing</li>
            <li>Someone else pulls out another gem and says this is what makes the Quran amazing</li>
            <li>The Quran is amazing because of History, Science, Recitation, etc</li>
            <li>The Quran is amazing for all of those and none of those reasons at the same time</li>
            <li>Some rulings of the Quran are the same universally</li>
            <li>Other ayat of the Quran have different perspectives for different people</li>
            <li>Allah constantly requires us to think</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What is a Surah</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Surah comes from the root word sawra which means a very sharp eyesight</li>
            <li>A long reaching view</li>
            <li>The very tall walls that surround a city</li>
            <li>The walls of a city that protect against invasion</li>
            <li>To be on top of a large scaling wall</li>
            <li>Many things are happening inside a surah like a city</li>
            <li>All the ayah in the surah are interconnected</li>
            <li>Like everything in the city is interconnected and everything comes together nicely</li>
            <li>Everything is interconnected like a body</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How is the Quran Organized</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The Quran is made of 114 surahs</li>
            <li>Two third of the Quran was revelaed in Makkah</li>
            <li>One third of the Quran was reaveled in Madinah</li>
            <li>The Quran is not in chronological order</li>
            <li>The Quran is not in revelation order</li>
            <li>The Quran is not in subject order</li>
            <li>The Quran is not in size order</li>
            <li>The Quran is in perfect order</li>
            <li>Allah revealed the order of the Quran and it is in divine order</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Alhamdulillah</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>All praise and thanks is due to Allah the one who crafts creation in the most perfect order</li>
            <li>In the most beautiful upright form and in the most subtle craft</li>
            <li>The one who places things in the appropriate of all places</li>
            <li>I send prayers and salutations on the one who was aided with the most eloquent of all speech</li>
            <li>The speech and the prophet that are so distinct that appear like a full moon in the middle of two clouds for the guidance of all manner of creation</li>
            <li>I send salutations on his family and his noble companions so long as the days and nights come to pass</li>
            <li>The one who knew where to place the sun, the moon, the stars, my fingers, and everything in creation</li>
            <li>does not know where to place the surahs in the quran</li>
            <li>And He left that to you and me, I cannot accept it</li>
            <li>May Allah forgive those who disagree with me</li>
        </ul>
