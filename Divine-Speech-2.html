        <a href="Divine-Speech.html"><h1>Verbal Idioms</h1></a>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <ul>
           <li>Language has many figures of speech</li>
           <li>Language is alive and dynamic</li>
           <li>Language changes a lot overtime</li>
           <li>Over the years the same word could mean different things</li>
           <li>Words cannot be taken literally all the time</li>
           <li>Allah uses verbal idioms or figures of speech in the Quran as well</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I gave means to give something like time or money</li>
            <li>I gave up means I quit</li>
            <li>Site to a construction worker it is a construction site</li>
            <li>Site to a web developer it is a web site</li>
            <li>There is also sight which means to see</li>
            <li>An accountant has an accounting journal</li>
            <li>A professor and student has an acedemic journal</li>
            <li>A teenage girl or storywriter has a personal journal</li>
            <li>Cool means it is awesome</li>
            <li>Cool is also the weather</li>
            <li>What's up means to look up</li>
            <li>What's up also means how are you</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Coolness of the Eyes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Shedding tears of joy</li>
            <li>Finding relief from a storm</li>
            <li>When your eyes stay in one place and it calms you down</li>
            <li>We make a dua in Surah Al Furqan Ayah 74 for coolness of the eyes</li>
            <li>Surah Qasas Ayah 9 Pharoah and his wife experience coolness of the eyes</li>
            <li>Surah Qasas Ayah 13 the mother of Musa's eyes are cool</li>
            <li>The Messenger said the coolness of my eyes were placed in my salah</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Lower your wings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Surah Isra Ayah 24</li>
            <li>We are being compared to a bird</li>
            <li>A bird is about to fly when raising its wings</li>
            <li>A bird is lowering its wings when it is coming back down to the earth</li>
            <li>So lowering your wings means to come back down to the earth</li>
            <li>It means to be humble</li>
            <li>A bird has the ability to fly and raise its wings but it still lowers them</li>
            <li>Allah is telling the children to lower their wings before their parents</li>
            <li>Children are completely dependent on the parents when they are younger</li>
            <li>As children get older the children must remain humble before their parents</li>
            <li>Allah says I know you have wings but pretend you don't when you are with your parents</li>
            <li>We should lower our wings because of the love and care our parents showed us</li>
            <li>Allah reverses the roles as time goes by</li>
            <li>We should show love and care to our parents so Allah will show love and care to us</li>
            <li>Lower the wings of the bird is a parent sacrificing itself for the child</li>
            <li>We protect our parents as they protected us when we were small</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Untie the Knot from my tongue</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Surah Taha Ayah 25</li>
            <li>A string is jumbled up and you do not know where it ends or where it begins</li>
            <li>When you tongue has a knot you do not have clarity of speech</li>
            <li>Unite the knot from my tongue means to get clarity of speech</li>
            <li>To have a clear beginning, a clear middle, and a clear end</li>
            <li>Having a knot in the tongue is like having a stutter</li>
        </ul>
