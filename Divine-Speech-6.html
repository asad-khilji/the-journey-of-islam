        <a href="Divine-Speech.html"><h1>Transitions in the Quran</h1></a>

        <h3>Adal and Kist in Surah Al Hujarat</h3>
        <ul>
                <li>Two groups of Muslims are fighting</li>
                <li>A and B are fighting then C should make peace</li>
                <li>If A fights B again then B & C should fight A</li>
                <li>Then when A stops fighting and wants to make peace again</li>
                <li>Then C should make peace between A and B with justice and make sure to not be unfair</li>
                <li>Making peace occured twice in the ayah</li>
                <li>The second time Allah added to make peace with justice and not to be unfair</li>
                <li>First C was neutral but second time C was involved in the fight too</li>
                <li>So Allah highlighted and reminded to make peace with justice and not to be unfair</li>
                <li>Because the second time around C had a tendency of being unfair</li>
                <li>Adl means open and public justice</li>
                <li>Kist means public or private justice</li>
                <li>The court is called adala means it is open and public</li>
                <li>In the first case Allah said do kist but in second case Allah said do adal</li>
           </ul>

           <h3>The Example of Purification</h3>
           <ul>
                   <li>In Surah Ali Imran Allah says so He can purifies those who believe</li>
                   <li>This ayah is from the contect of battle of uhud</li>
                   <li>During Uhud Muslims went to a lot difficulties</li>
                   <li>The word used means purifying gold by melting it</li>
                   <li>There is a lot of intense heat involved</li>
                   <li>The flames here in the ayah are the flames of war</li>
                   <li>Allah called the sahaba gold and the hypocrites impurities</li>
              </ul>

                   <li>Surah Al Baqarah Ayah 57</li>
                   <li>In one group Allah is addressing us, the Muslims</li>
                   <li>In another group Allah is addressing Bani Israel</li>
                   <li>In the third group Allah is addressing the Prophet</li>
                   <li>Allah says to Bani Israel I gave you manna and salwa and shaded you with clothes</li>
                   <li>Allah says to Bani Israel to eat and drink from my favors</li>
                   <li>Then Allah turns to us the muslims and says they did not wrong Us but they only wronged thmeselves</li>
                   <li>Allah uses iltifat or this transition like a camera changing angles and scenes</li>
                   <li>There are three different conversations and each group can hear the other conversations</li>
                   <li>Half the ayah Allah says you and the other half Allah says they</li>

                      <li>How they will be enjoying the fruits of Jannah</li>
                      <li>Then Allah switches to the pronoun you</li>
                      <li>And Allah says You eat and drink care free because of the wonderful things you used to do</li>
