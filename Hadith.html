    <main>

        <h3>Hadith 1</h3>
        <p>On the authority of Amirul Mumineen Abu Hafs Umar bin Khattab who said I heard the Messenger of Allah say, Verily all actions are only judged by its intentions, and every person shall have whatever he or she intends. Those who intend to migrate for Allah and His Messenger then their migration is for Allah and His Messenger. But he who intends to migrate for a worldy purpose or a woman he wants to marry then his migration is for what he intended. Narrated in Bukhari and Muslim.</p>

        <h3>Hadith 2</h3>
        <p>Also on the authority of Umar bin Khattab who said when we were sitting down together with the Messenger of Allah suddenly there was one man whose clothes were extremely white and whose hair was extremely black and there was no indication of travelling in him, however none of us recognized. Then he was sitting close to the Prophet, rested his knees against the knees of the Prophet, and put his hands on the thighs of the Prophet. He then asked Muhammad tell me about Islam. The Prophet said Islam is that you testify that none has the right to be worship except Allah who has no partners and that you testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, perform salah, pay zakah, fast during ramadhan, and make a pilgrimmage to Makkah once if you are able to. The man said you are right. Umar said we were astonished the man was the one who asked the question yet he answered it himself. The man continued asking tell me what is Imaan. The Prophet said Imaan is that you believe in Allah, His angels, His books, His Messengers, the last day, and qadr, the good and the bad. The man said you are right. He continued to ask tell me what is Ihsan. The Prophet said Ihsan is that you worship Allah as though you can see Him and know that though you cannot see Him verily He can see you. The man asked tell me when will the day of resurrection occur. The Prophet said the one who asked the question knows no more than the one who is being asked. The man said then tell me its signs. The Prophet said the women slaves will give birth to its master and you will see people without any shoes, dislike clothing, become poor, and men who guard flock of sheep compete to build something as high as possible. The man went off, while I (Umar) kept silent for the next few days. The Prophet said Umar do you know who the questioner was last time? Umar said Allah and His Messenger know better. The Prophet said verily he was Jibreel who came to teach you all your religion. Narrated in Muslim.</p>

        <h3>Hadith 3</h3>
        <p>On the auhority of Abu Abdur Rahman Abdullah bin Umar bin Khattab he said I heard the Prophet say Islam is built based on five pillars: testifying that there is no one worthy of worship except Allah and Muhammad is His slave and Messenger, perform salah, give zakah, fast during ramadhan, and make a pilgrimmage to Makkah once if you are albel to. Narrated in Bukhari and Muslim.</p>

        <h3>Hadith 4</h3>
        <p>On the auhority of Abu Abdur Rahman Abdullah bin Masood, The Prophet informed us and he is the most honest and righteous among us, Verily the process of creating you in your mother's wombs last for 40 days in the form of a drop of fluid, and then turns into a lump of meat which hangs for 40 days as well. Allah then sends an angel to blow a spirit to him and command the angel to take note of four decrees: his provision, his life span, his deeds, and his last day whether he will be someone who is blessed or wretched. By Allah whom there is no other deity, indeed there is one who performs the deeds of the people of paradise until the distance between him and paradise is an arms length then his initial fate outstrips him and he performs the deeds of the people of hell until th distance between him and hell is an arms length and he ends up going to hell. There is also one who performs the deeds of the people of hell until the distance between him and hell is an arms length then his initial fate outstrips him and he performs the deeds of the people of paradise until the distance between him and paradise is an arms length and he ends up going to paradise. Narrated in Bukhari and Muslim.</p>
