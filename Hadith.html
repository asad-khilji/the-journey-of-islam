        <h3>Hadith 1</h3>
        <p>On the authority of Amirul Mumineen Abu Hafs Umar bin Khattab who said I heard the Messenger of Allah say, Verily all actions are only judged by its intentions, and every person shall have whatever he or she intends. Those who intend to migrate for Allah and His Messenger then their migration is for Allah and His Messenger. But he who intends to migrate for a worldy purpose or a woman he wants to marry then his migration is for what he intended. Narrated in Bukhari and Muslim.</p>
